In an era dominated by visual communication, the need for user-friendly and accessible photo editing tools has never been more pronounced. In this project, I created a straightforward yet effective photo editor using Python. The main objective was to design an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to perform basic photo editing tasks. The technologies employed in this project include Seaborn, Tkinter, and Pickle.

## Project Overview

This Photo Editor is designed to provide a seamless experience through a well-crafted graphical user interface built using the Tkinter library. Leveraging the capabilities of the PILLOW library, the editor facilitates fundamental image adjustments, filters, and the addition of text overlays. Whether users are looking to fine-tune personal photographs or add creative elements to their visuals, this project offers a user-friendly environment for achieving desired results.

## Key Features

1. **Graphical User Interface**: The project employs Tkinter to create an intuitive and accessible GUI, making it easy for users to navigate and utilize the photo editing features.
2. **Image Adjustments**: Basic functionalities such as cropping, resizing, and rotating images are supported, providing users with essential tools for photo enhancement.
3. **Filters and Effects**: A variety of filters can be applied to images, allowing users to experiment with different visual styles and effects.
4. **Text Overlays**: Users can add text to their images, offering a way to personalize or annotate photos.
5. **Seamless Integration**: The PILLOW library is used for image processing, ensuring smooth and efficient handling of image files.
6. **Data Persistence**: Using the Pickle module, the project supports saving and loading of user settings and editing sessions, enhancing user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface.
- **PILLOW**: For image processing and manipulation.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization, providing a visual understanding of image properties.
- **Pickle**: For saving and loading user preferences and editing sessions.
